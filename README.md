### COVID-19 death rate forecasts for 41 largest Brazilian municipalities

COVID-19 death rate forecasts per 100,000 inhabitants across nine forecasting windows for the 41 largest Brazilian municipalities are available at https://github.com/helderseixas/thesis/tree/main/ForecastingCharts. The black line represents the observed death rate displayed as a 7-day rolling average, while the colored lines illustrate the predictions from the various models. Shaded areas indicate the 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The dotted vertical lines indicate the forecast dates for the analysis windows, with each 84-day window labeled as _Wi_ where _i_ ranges from the first window (_W1_) to the ninth window (_W9_).
